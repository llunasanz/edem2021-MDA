The upside is that the hobby brought out the 'mechanic' in him and that has been amazing to watch.Regular maintenance after every few hours of run time includes break-down\t clean and refill of the shocks\t and he has tested many different weight shock oils and different strength springs over the years. He is tough on these cars and has built several jumps\t so he need the shocks\t shock coils and shock oil to really stand up to the punishment. For the last year or so\t Losi shock oils have become his favorite as their oils just seems to stand up well for a longer period of time.Depending on weather conditions and the type of running he is planning to do (off-road\t pavement speed runs\t dirt track racing...)\t our son will use different weight shock oils in the car... but his most frequently used oils are 40\t 45 and 50 weight. Since he cleans the shock regularly\t we typically purchase the larger 4 ounce bottles instead of smaller ones.If you are looking for a good remote control car or truck shock oil\t for uses as I have described above\t then our son totally recommends that you give Losi Shock Oil a try based on his experience with it. Highly recommended\t especially in these more economically priced larger bottles.Go for it\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"TTM-Funktionsmodellbau\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£7.64\"\"}\n on 24 Feb. 2015 // good\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£8.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£8.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"trainmad\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£7.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£28.63\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 11 April 2015 // He loved it\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Modelsales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£13.50\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"BuySend\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£15.79\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£37.69\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 21 Jan. 2016 // top toy\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.94\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"GiftLocalUK\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.96\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Sell 24x7\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£13.07\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"Fun Fuzion\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£10.38\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"Life Unearthed\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£14.31\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"Venture Blue\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£14.47\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Mini Model Shop\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£12.76\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£16.31\"\"}\n on 1 Mar. 2015 // well pleased with item and service many thanks\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.62\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"UKBulksales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.62\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Hair Skin Beauty\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£12.64\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"jadlamracingmodels\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£12.72\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"Buy-For-Less-Online\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£12.77\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"GamesQuest\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£13.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Model Kits Direct\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£11.76\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"DVDCineShop\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£10.34\"\"}\n on 1 Jan. 2015 // Very good had to return due to ordering wrong scale\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£6.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£6.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£24.11\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 17 Sept. 2014 // verygood\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£52.97\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Frome Models Centre\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£52.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"tablet_books\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£85.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£114.59\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"japazon\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£123.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"Sam Store US\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£300.25\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 23 Sept. 2014 // have not finished the decals and colors yet but it is good\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£10.48\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Hair Skin Beauty\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£10.50\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"jadlamracingmodels\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£10.56\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"Buy-For-Less-Online\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£11.22\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"GamesQuest\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£10.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"UKBulksales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£13.39\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Model Kits Direct\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£9.14\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"McKeeman Models\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£10.99\"\"}\n on 4 Oct. 2014 // Dispatched quickly and just as advertised…a brand new model kit in a sealed box.

CPSIA certified. Lead Free It's like having 3 beads in one, but they can be used to help indicate the strength of the sun, so make sure you cover up when they're glowing! Not all sunscreen lotions are the same, as can be evidenced by a lobster-like appearance after a day of being outside. Instead of using your skin as a detector of ultra-violet light (UV), try experimenting with UV Beads. Test the effectiveness of sunscreen, or experiment with colour while you learn about the power of sunlight. They're also ideal for children as a constant reminder of the impact the sun can have. They will change colour backwards and forwards many times. Test the ability of your sunglasses to block out ultraviolet light by covering a few beads with the lens of your sunglasses, if the beads do not change colour, your sunglasses block out harmful ultraviolet light from your eyes. Test a variety of glass and plastic containers to determine which materials block out UV light. The beads are all white in visible light in UV light you will see different colors. Each bead will change colour. These UV Beads are the perfect tool for understanding how solar radiation can be harmful. UV Colour changing pigments are intended for intermittent and random exposure to UV rays. Continuous exposure to UV rays overtime will compromise the colour changing properties. The contact of sunscreen products on the beads can also impact on the colour changing pigments of the beads. Warning:Keep out of reach of children.

What people are saying about us...This Click-A-Brick Army Defenders educational building block set is wonderful! I have a five year old little boy and this has been the biggest hit. He has always been a fan of Lego's and he thought this was so much fun. As a parent I really appreciate that Click-A-Bricks are very easy to build and my 5 year old doesn't need much help. The pieces are very easy to put together and take apart. My son was able to build on his own without any frustration which was a relief for me as a mother. This set is so comprehensive and the possibilities are endless. My boy had so much fun just using his imagination to build. This set also comes with a step by step easy to follow guide for building everything shown in the listing photos. The bricks are very high quality and fit together perfectly. They are very solid. My boy has been having a blast with them. He can't wait for the next set. - Bella Forte The kids had a BLAST with this set! I have 6 children and it was a hit with all of them! Once I opened the box, it was like a swarm of locusts – picking out pieces, looking at the manual (which shows step by step how to make everything), and clicking them together. The kiddos quickly just started using their imagination and making things on their own. The blocks snap together in a sort of 3D way, so they have to think ahead of what they are building to ensure they have the right configuration – which is great from an educational aspect. They had some feedback about the occasional difficulty when pulling the bricks apart, and the company was able to promptly provide the answers I was looking for, and even had a solution. Great product, and great company! When asked what they liked about it the most, they said the colors and the eyeballs! - Skyler This was our first Click-A-Brick purchase and my daughter and I are really impressed! My daughter has not set them down since they've arrived (she's currently holding onto them while napping on the couch). She just had an appendectomy and this was the only toy she wanted at the hospital. This toy really encourages a child's imagination! The Click-A-Brick set that purchased was the Feather Friends 30pc Educational Block Set! First, we checked to make sure all 30 pieces were present {and they were}, then we followed the directions to build one of the birds {the parrot}, it turned out pretty well. Since then my daughter has made all different kinds of birds, people, beds, bridges, etc. out of the blocks! Each time she comes up, so excited, to show everyone what she has created. We looked it up and it seems as if there are 6 other sets being sold by Click-A-Brick on Amazon, my daughter would love them all and I will be purchasing at least a few for her for Christmas! Really thrilled with Click-A-Brick as a whole and especially the Feather Friends set! - Sarah Leatherman\tTechnical Details Item Weight9 g Product Dimensions18.5 x 12.7 x 3.6 cm Manufacturer recommended age:4 - 12 years Manufacturer referenceTXJA-016 Educational Objective(s)Spacial Awareness Number of Puzzle Pieces30 Assembly RequiredNo Batteries Required?No Batteries Included?No Remote Control Included?No    Additional Information ASINB00PCPCZJC Best Sellers Rank 6,615 in Toys & Games (See top 100) #471 in Toys & Games > Building & Construction Toys Shipping Weight9 g Delivery Destinations:Visit the Delivery Destinations Help page to see where this item can be delivered.

Gresley. It was employed on long-distance express trains on the LNER and its successors, British Railways Eastern and North-Eastern Regions, notably on the 10am London to Edinburgh Flying Scotsman service after which it was named. In its career 4472 Flying Scotsman has covered more than 2,000,000 miles (3,200,000 km).Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue. Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges. With this in mind it is easy to see that those models that make up the Hornby RailRoad range are a simple and cost effective way of adding to a train set providing a suitable and most appropriate stepping stone into the varied and fascinating World of model railways.The introductory range offers not only a selection of individual locomotives, rolling stock and accessories but an assortment of train and wagon packs ideally suited for either train set rolling stock enhancements or for those who wish to experiment and try their hands at developing their modelling techniques!This DCC Ready locomotive is compatible with analogue train layouts, but can easily be converted for use on a DCC (digital) layout. This loco is 'DCC Ready', meaning they feature a special socket ready to receive a DCC Decoder. To convert this locomotive for use on a DCC layout one of the following digital decoder chips are required; R8245 Sapphire Decoder or R8249 V1 3 NMRA Loco Decoder.

Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges. With this in mind it is easy to see that those models that make up the Hornby RailRoad range are a simple and cost effective way of adding to a train set providing a suitable and most appropriate stepping stone into the varied and fascinating World of model railways.The introductory range offers not only a selection of individual locomotives, rolling stock and accessories but an assortment of train and wagon packs ideally suited for either train set rolling stock enhancements or for those who wish to experiment and try their hands at developing their modelling techniques!This locomotive is suitable with analogue train layouts only and is not DCC compatible.

Originally numbered as LNER 2595, Trigo was the eleventh of twenty-seven A3s to be built as an A3, the other fifty-one were A1s that were later converted to A3s. All the A1 and A3 Class locomotives were named after famous race horses. Trigo was an Irish born race horse who won the Epsom Derby in 1929 making the horse famous and inspiring the LNE R to name one of their new locomotives after him. Trigo is modelled here as British Rail (BR) 60084 in BR blue from the era of June 1949 to August 1952, during this period Trigo pulled a Streamline type tender and was based at the Neville Hill shed in Leeds.
